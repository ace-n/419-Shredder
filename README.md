============

Playing around with OpenPOP3 (for .NET), Microsoft <s>Hotmail</s> Outlook and spam filtering techniques.
Currently, this is mainly a Hotmail-access API coupled with a simple (but fairly effective) spam detection system.

Note that OpenPOP.NET is <b>not</b> my code. It can be found <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hpop/">here</a>.
